A sleek British sports car talks directly to us in a
pixilated, garbled video. He's OUT OF BREATH. Crates are
visible behind him. We're in the shadowy bowels of a steel
room.

This is Agent Leland Turbo. I have
a flash transmission for Agent Finn
McMissile.


Finn. My cover's been compromised.
Everything's gone pear-shaped.


You won't believe what I've found
out here.

He angles our camera view, reveals a PORTHOLE through which
we can see flames rising in the distance.

This is bigger than anything we've
ever seen. And no one even knows it
exists. Finn, I need backup. But
don't call the cavalry - it could
blow the operation. And be careful.
It's not safe out here!

ANGRY VOICES O.S. Time for Turbo to go.

Transmitting my grids now. Good
luck!

Coordinates appear: 40 6.80' N - 172 23.84' W




A TINY CRAB BOAT (CRABBY) crests over massive swells.

Alright buddy, we're here. Right
where you paid me to bring you.
Question is, why?

A metallic blue sports car, circa the `60s, emerges from the


shadows. Cagey, smooth, he'd turn heads driving through any
intersection in the world. Meet FINN MCMISSILE.

I'm looking for a car.

A car? Hey pal, you can't get any
further away from land than out
here.

Exactly where I want to be.

Well I got news for you, buddy.
There's nobody out here but us.

Suddenly, a HORN -- a COMBAT SHIP, the size of most cruise
ships. FINN quickly backs into the shadows, out of sight.

What are you doing out here?

What does it look like, genius? I'm
crabbing!

Well turn around and go back where
you came from.

Yeah? And who's gonna make me?

A laser sight hits Crabby between the eyes.

Alright, alright! Don't get your
prop in a twist.
(as he turns to leave)
What a jerk. Sorry, buddy. Looks
like it's the end of the line.
Buddy?

ON CRABBY'S DECK: Finn is gone.

FINN - He HANGS off the side of COMBAT SHIP, clandestine.

We're with Finn as the ship continues on, cuts through the
darkness with purpose. Suddenly small flames appear, perhaps
a knot or so away. Then WHOOSH!!! A flame rises above Finn,
the ship. It illuminates an OIL DERRICK.


THWAP! Finn fires a GRAPPLING HOOK to the derrick and SWINGS
toward it. He's going to SLAM into the side with brute force

--- HIS TIRES sprout a magnetic exoskeleton. He STICKS to the
derrick and now DRIVES VERTICALLY UP UP UP...

From this vantage point, hundreds of derricks appear.


Finn approaches a loading bay from above, hides. He watches
as GREMLINS, PACERS and assorted other cars scurry about.

Leland Turbo, this is Finn
McMissile. I'm at the rally point.
Over.

No response.

Leland, it's Finn. Please respond.
Over.

AN ACCESS DOOR OPENS LOUDLY below. A boxy, monacle-wearing
German car enters. This is PROFESSOR OTTO ZUNDAPP.

(in German and English)
Too many cars here. Out of my way!

Professor Zundapp?

Here it is, Professor.

Zundapp approaches a NOSY PACER who idles next to a CRATE.

You wanted to see this before we
load it?

Ah, yes. Very carefully...

A forklift opens the crate -- inside is a TV CAMERA, packed
carefully in foam. Finn SNAPS PHOTOS FURIOUSLY.

Oh. A TV camera. What does it
actually do?


This camera is extremely dangerous.

What are you up to now, Professor?

Finn, angling for a better view, FIRES SUSPENSION WIRES ---

--- which sail clear to the other side of the derrick ---

--- THOK! They hook tightly onto a steel girder.

Finn slides out ONTO THE WIRE like an acrobat, then expels
another cross-wire for support.

This is valuable equipment. Make
sure it is properly secured for the
voyage.

You got it.

Finn LOWERS HIMSELF. He snaps more pictures.

Hey, Professor Z!

Zundapp turns as a CRANE LOWERS A CAR-SIZED CRATE. GREM and
ACER, an orange Gremlin and a green Pacer, flank it.

This is one of those British spies
we told you about.

Yeah. This one we caught sticking
his bumper where it didn't belong.

Finn PRODUCES SEMI-AUTOMATIC GUNS from his side, readies
himself for a tag-team spy fight with his buddy Leland.

Agent Leland Turbo.

The crate is lifted, revealing a CRUSHED, CUBED Leland Turbo.

Finn's eyes go wide. Suddenly --- WHOOOSHHH! Another derrick
flame rises behind him, casts a Finn-shaped SHADOW over the
Professor. He looks up.


It's Finn McMissile! He's seen the
camera! Kill him!!

Finn UNLOADS with bullets as he starts to retreat --- He

BAD GUY CARS are waiting for him on the catwalk where he just
came from - BLOWTORCHES ready.

Finn, stuck in midair, notices an angry CRANE. Finn GRINS,
having just found his escape.

THWAPTHWAPTHWAP!!! Finn releases three of his four cables,
swinging, Indiana Jones-style on the last one TOWARD THE

--- where he lands on its BOOM, drives UP and LAUNCHES OFF IT
where he LANDS - MOVING - onto another deck!

Finn now DRIVES, spraying oil and screeching around corners.
A GREMLIN in pursuit hits the oil patch, loses control ---

--- and PLUMMETS OFF the side of the rig!

The Gremlin FALLS... it's like an eternity...

He smashes into the water and breaks into a million pieces.

ON FINN - Now set upon by 20 or 30 MORE pursuing cars. He has
nowhere to go but UP UP UP a ramp toward the helipad. He
spies some GASOLINE BARRELS, fires a SINGLE BULLET which cuts
through its leather straps, sending barrels DOWN the ramp,

--- PAST the pursuing CARS ---

--- to the bottom where they EXPLODE in a CHAIN REACTION back
UP THE RAMP, taking out at least 15 CARS!

ON THE HELIPAD - Finn blasts into view, pulls to a stop. No
more road. Nowhere else to go.

The 20 BAD GUY CARS that are still in pursuit surround him,
fire up their blowtorches. About to pounce.

Finn GRINS. The second time we've seen this grin. It means
he's got something cooking.

Finn's REVERSE LIGHTS appear. He DRIVES BACKWARD off the edge
of the helipad to the SHOCK of the other cars.

Finn falls. He turns himself so he's grill first, cleanly
cutting into the water.


He EMERGES, now sprouting HYDROFOIL and speeds away.

Get to the boats.

THE BOATS - an army of combat ships quickly DROP into the sea
and CHURN WATER with unprecedented fury as they quickly make
up the distance between them and Finn, FIRING BULLETS as they
do so.

He's getting away!

Not for long.

The LEAD COMBAT SHIP quietly drops a TORPEDO into the water.
It skips along, connecting with Finn in his rear and
EXPLODING with such force that water skyrockets into the
night clouds.

UNDERWATER - McMissile SINKS. Then, he blinks. He GRINS.
We're starting to like this grin and what follows it. He now
CONVERTS into a submarine. From his trunk he releases four
DECOY tires which float to the surface like body parts.

ON THE DERRICK - Professor Zundapp watches it all from far
away.

He's dead, Professor.

Wunderbar. With Finn McMissile
gone, who can stop us now?


TOW MATER, a rusty tow truck, putters into view.

Mater. Tow Mater, that's who... is
here to help you!

He approaches a broken-down sedan on the side of the road. He
drives around to the front, catching OTIS' face for the first
time.

Hey, Otis!


Hey, Mater. Gosh, I'm so sorry. I
thought I could make it this time,
but...
(he tries to start his
engine, stalls)
Smooth like pudding, huh? Ah, who
am I kidding? I'll always be a
lemon.

Mater hooks his friend and starts towing him.

Well dadgum, you're leaking oil
again. Must be your gaskets. Hey,
look on the bright side: This is
your tenth tow this month, so that
means it's on the house.

You're the only one that's nice to
lemons like me, Mater.

Don't sweat it. These things happen
to everybody, Otis.

But you never leak oil.

Yeah, but I ain't perfect. Don't
tell nobody, but I think my rust is
starting to show through.

Mater and Otis drive past THE RADIATOR SPRINGS WELCOME SIGN.
It has been amended to say: "Home of Lightning McQueen."

Hey, is Lightning McQueen back yet?

Not yet.

He must be crazy-excited about
winning his fourth Piston Cup.
Four! Wow!


Yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him.
But I sure wish he'd hurry up and
get back `cause we got a whole
summer's worth of best friend fun
to make up for. Just me and --

Ahead of them, a half-mile off, a RED RACE CAR is visible.

--- McQueen!

Mater FLOORS IT, dragging poor Otis behind him.

Uh, Mater? I'm in no hurry. You
don't need to go so fast!

Boom! They hit a bump. Otis catches air.


Lightning McQueen is surrounded by his hometown friends.

Oh, Lightning. Welcome home.

Good to have you back, honey.

Congratulations, man.

Welcome home, soldier.

The place wasn't the same without
you, son.

What? Did he go somewhere?

It's good to be home, everybody.

McQueen!

They all turn around, see Mater speeding into town, with Otis
swerving behind him.

Mater!


McQueen!

Mater skids into main street and in one swift motion,
slingshots Otis forward ---

Woaahhhhh!

--- right through Ramone's front door ---


--- where he lands perfectly on the hydraulic lift. Ramone
lifts him up, routine.

Hey. How far'd you make it this
time, Otis?

Halfway to the county line.

Not bad, man.

I know, I can't believe it either!


McQueen, welcome back!

Mater, it's so good to see you.

You too, buddy.

Mater and McQueen do an ELABORATE TIRE BUMP (fist bump
style).

Oh, man. You ain't gonna believe
the things I got planned for us.

Everyone watches as the tire bump continues.

(to Lizzie, an aside)
These best friend greetings get
longer every year.


You ready to have some serious fun?

Well, actually I've got something
to show you first.


CLOSE ON THE PISTON CUP. It has now changed, been adorned
with a small likeness of Doc. It says "Hudson Hornet Piston
Cup."

Wow. I can't believe they renamed
the Piston Cup after our very own
Doc Hudson.

McQueen and Mater are alone, the museum closed to the public.
McQueen approaches a "Hudson Hornet" wall with Doc's three
Piston cups, framed articles, other racing ephemera.

I know Doc said these things were
just old cups, but to have someone
else win it just didn't feel right,
you know?

Well, Doc would've been real proud
of you. That's for sure.

McQueen takes this in.


McQueen and Mater exit the Doc Hudson Museum.

Alright, pal. I've been waiting all
summer for this. What've you got
planned?

You sure you can handle it?

Come on, you know who you're
talking to? This is Lightning
McQueen. I can handle anything.



Mater and McQueen roll on an old train track, their tires
off. They're on their rims.

Uh.... Mater?!

Just remember, your brakes ain't
gonna work on these!

As they head INTO A DARK TUNNEL ---

Mater!

Relax, these train tracks ain't
been used in years!

From inside the tunnel a loud TRAIN HORN. The two friends
emerge, going as fast as they can on train tracks, uphill,
with no tires.

Come on, come on! Faster, faster!

Moments later a harmless GALLOPING GOOSE appears, oversized
horn visible, cackling and laughing at his prank.


An ENORMOUS EARTH MOVER sleeps. McQueen and Mater sneak up.

This is gonna be good!

They blow their horns and he TIPS OVER, tractor-tipping
style. They LAUGH at the gag, but soon realize the earth
mover's GIANT EXHAUST PIPE is directly above them.

Uh-oh. This ain't gonna be good.

The exhaust pipe BELCHES. McQueen and Mater are BLASTED out
of view.


The sun sets. McQueen and Mater roll into town. McQueen looks
exhausted. Mater is still full of energy.


Boy, this was the best day ever!
And my favorite souvenir?

Mater proudly shows off a dent.

This new dent!

Boy, Mater. Today was, uh...

Shoot, that was nothing. Wait til
you see what I got planned for
tonight.

Mater, Mater. Whoa. I was kind of
thinking of just a quiet dinner.

That's exactly what I was thinking.

No, I... I meant with Sally, Mater.

Even better! You, me and Miss Sally
going out for supper.

McQueen pulls around in front of Mater, stops.

Mater, I meant it would be just me
and Sally.

Oh.

It's just for tonight. We'll do
whatever you want tomorrow.

Okay.

Thanks for understanding.

Yeah, sure. Y'all go on and have
fun now.


Alright, then. See ya soon, amigo!

McQueen drives off. Mater watches him go.


It's been converted into a white-tablecloth restaurant, with
cars dining al fresco and a hopping gastropub inside.

MCQUEEN AND SALLY have a prime table with a view of Radiator
Springs and the starry night sky.

This is so nice.

I can't tell you how good it is to
be here alone. Just the two of us.
Finally, you and me ---

Good evening.

Mater is at their table, dressed as a waiter.

My name is Mater and I'll be your
waiter.
Mater the waiter. That's funny
right there.

Mater, you work here?

Well yeah I work here. What'd you
think, I just snuck in here when
nobody was looking and pretended to
be your waiter, just so I could
hang out with you?

McQueen and Sally exchange a look.

Oh, yeah. How ridiculous would that
be?

Now, can I start you two lovebirds
off with a couple drinks?


Yes. I'll have my usual.

You know what? I'm going to have
that too.

Mater blinks.

Uh, right. Your usual.

INSIDE AT THE BAR - Fillmore and Sarge watch as Guido mixes
drinks, ala "Cocktail." Mater arrives.

Guido! What's McQueen's usual?

(in Italian, subtitled)
How should I know?

Perfect! Give me two of `em.

Quiet! My program's on.

Tonight on "The Mel Dorado Show"!

ON THE BAR TV - "THE MEL DORADO SHOW," a cable talk show,
begins with file footage of MILES AXLEROD, a sleek SUV.

His story gripped the world! Oil
billionaire Miles Axlerod, in an
attempt to become the first car to
circumnavigate the globe without
GPS, ironically ran out of gas and
found himself trapped in the wild!

We see images of newspaper headlines, search crews.

Feared dead, he emerged 36 days
later, running on a fuel he'd
distilled himself from the natural
elements! Since then he's sold his
oil fortune, converted himself from
a gas-guzzler into an electric car,
and has devoted his life to finding
a renewable, clean-burning fuel!


Images of oil derricks torn down; Miles Axlerod getting
converted to electric; lab scientists testing chemicals.

Now he claims to have done it with
his Allinol.

Images of fields, rivers, vegetables, and mountains all
combining to form the Allinol logo.

And to show the world what his new
superfuel can do, he's created a
racing competition like no other,
inviting the greatest champions
from around the globe to battle in
the first ever World Grand Prix.
Welcome Sir Miles Axlerod.

SIR MILES AXLEROD arrives, parks across from Mel's desk.

Thank you, Mel. It is very good to
be here. Now listen to me: Big Oil.
It costs a fortune. Pollution is
getting worse. I mean, come on.
It's a fossil fuel. Fossil. As in
dead dinosaurs. And we all know
what happened to them. Alternative
energy is the future. Trust me,
Mel, after seeing Allinol in action
at the World Grand Prix, nobody
will ever go back to gasoline
again.

What happened to the dinosaurs,
now?

And on satellite, a World Grand
Prix competitor and one of the
fastest cars in the world,
Francesco Bernoulli.

Across the screen: LIVE FROM ROME, ITALY. We meet Formula
race car FRANCESCO BERNOULLI.

It is an honor, Signore Dorado. For
you.


Miles, why not invite Lightning
McQueen?

Mater, collecting his drinks, looks up, half-intrigued.

Of course we invited him. But
apparently after a very long racing
season he is taking some time off
to rest.

Lightning McQueen would not have a
chance against Francesco!

Mater doesn't like this.

I can go over 300 kilometers an
hour! In miles that is like, uh...
way faster than McQueen.

Let's go to the phones. Baltimore,
Maryland, you're on the air.

Am I on? Hello?

You're on. Go ahead.

Hello?

Go ahead, caller.

Dial tone.

Let's go to Radiator Springs.
You're on, caller.

Yeah, that Italian feller you got
on there can't talk that way about
Lightning McQueen. He's the bestest
race car in the whole wide world.

Fillmore and Sarge look around. Mater is visible in the back
of the bar on an office phone.


Uh-oh...

If he is, how you say "the bestest
race car," then why must he rest,
eh?

Cause he knows what's important.
Every now and then he prefers just
to slow down, enjoy life.

Ah, you heard it! Lightning McQueen
prefers to be slow! Of course, this
is not news to Francesco. When I
want to go to sleep I watch one of
his races. After two laps I am out
cold.

Audible RXNS from the bar. A crowd has been forming ever
since Mater started talking.

That ain't what I meant.

MCQUEEN AND SALLY - They hear the commotion inside.

Hey, what's going on over there?

THE BAR - Sally and McQueen push through the crowd, see that
they're watching Francesco on the television.

Oh, it's that Italian Formula car.
His name is ---

Francesco Bernoulli. No wonder
there's a crowd.

When Sally says his name, she enunciates each part, as if Italian were her mother's tongue.

Wait, why do you know his name? 
And don't say it like that. 
It's three syllables, not ten.


What? He's nice to look at. 
You know, open-wheeled and all.

What's wrong with fenders? I
thought you like my fenders.

Well let me tell you something else
there, Mr. San Francisco ---

Mater?

McQueen could drive circles around
you.

Driving in circles is all he can
do, no?

No! I mean yes. I mean he could
beat you anywhere, anytime, any
track.

On McQueen - he looks at Guido who gives a nod over to ---

--- Mater, turned away from the crowd, still on the phone.

Mel, can we move on? Francesco
needs a caller who can provide a
little more intellectual
stimulation. Like a dump truck.

ON MCQUEEN. He doesn't like this at all.

Ha ha! That shows what you know.
Dump trucks is dumb.

Suddenly, Mater is YANKED from the booth and replaced by
McQueen.

Yeah, hi, this is Lightning
McQueen. Look, I don't appreciate
my best friend being insulted like
that.


McQueen! That was your best friend?
This is the difference between you
and Francesco. Francesco knows how
good he is. He does not need to
surround himself with tow trucks to
prove it.

Those are strong words from a car
that is so fragile.

Fragil�!? He calls Francesco
fragil�? Not so fast, McQueen!

"Not so fast." What is that, your
new motto?

Francesco goes ballistic in Italian. They cut his mic.

Well, this sounds like something
that needs to be settled on the
race course. What do you say,
Lightning McQueen? We've still got
room for one more racer.

Well, I would love to. The only
thing is my crew's off for the
season so ---

A sound O.S. McQueen turns to see Fillmore, Sarge and Luigi
flank a tablecloth which is hanging off the bar. Ramone backs
away, having spray painted "TEAM LIGHTNING MCQUEEN" on it.
Guido quickly uncorks three wine bottles.

Pit stop.

McQueen turns back to the phone.

You know what? They just got back.
Deal me in, baby. Ka-chow!

The place ERUPTS IN CHEERS.

MOMENTS LATER - General excitement as McQueen exits the phone
booth where Sally waits. Off her look:


I know, I know. I just got back.
But we won't be long and ---

Oh, no, don't worry about me. I've
got enough to do here. Mater's
going to have a blast though.
(off McQueen's silence)
You're bringing Mater, right? You
never bring him to any of your
races.

McQueen turns to the bar where Mater privately tries their
drinks, hates it, spits it back in the glass.

Just let him sit in the pits, give
him a headset. C'mon, it'll be a
thrill of a lifetime for him.

Mater arrives.

Your drinks, sir.

Mater.

I didn't taste it!

How'd you like to come and see the
world with me?

You mean it?

You got me into this thing. You're
coming along.


- McQueen is given a new paint job and headlights by Ramone.
Mater, now sporting a "Team McQueen" emblem, seems psyched as
well.

- An airport DEPARTURES SIGN advertises the next flight:
Tokyo, Japan.

- Mater waves goodbye with his hook alongside McQueen, Guido,
Luigi, Fillmore and Sarge as ---


--- the rest of Radiator Springs watches them board a plane.
Red bawls.

- IN THE JET, LATER. McQueen and Mater are the only ones
awake, watch an insane Japanese game show.

- JAPAN AT NIGHT. A stylish Tokyo cityscape of neon, glamour,
scrolling billboards, vending machines and high-tech
skyscrapers.

- INSIDE A SOUVENIR SHOP loaded with McQueen toys: Mater and
McQueen enter. A tourist sees McQueen and faints.

- A KABUKI THEATER. Team McQueen watches a methodical dance.
Mater, dressed in Kabuki makeup, arrives. He looks insane.

- A SUMO MATCH - Two SUZUKI SAMURAI CARS wrestle over a
parking space. Mater, now in his element, cheers.

The MONTAGE ENDS on this high note as we CUT TO ---


---- TEAM MCQUEEN, as they roll up the red carpet. Press is
held at bay behind ropes. WORLD GRAND PRIX and ALLINOL logos
are strategically placed for maximum press exposure. RACERS
are interviewed by press behind the red-carpet ropes.


Team McQueen enters via a second floor landing which
overlooks a massive indoor party in a converted museum. As
they roll down a ramp to the party, they are awed.

Guido, look! Ferraris and tires!
Let's go!

Hey, look at this. Okay now Mater,
remember: best behavior.

You got it, buddy. Hey, what's
that?

He sees something, peels away.

Mater!

Hey, McQueen, over here!


It's fellow racers JEFF GORVETTE and LEWIS HAMILTON. McQueen
now has no choice but to let Mater go.

Hey, Jeff. Lewis!

MATER as he approaches a GLASS-ENCLOSED ROCK GARDEN where a
pitty RAKES rocks with precision. He knocks on the glass with
his hook.

Hey! You done good! You got all the
leaves!

People turn at the noise he's making.

MCQUEEN, JEFF and LEWIS.

Check out that tow truck.

I wonder who that guy's with?

Will you guys excuse me just for
one little second?

He zips over to Mater's side, quickly pulls him out of sight.

Mater, listen. This isn't Radiator
Springs.

You're just realizing that? Boy,
that jet-lag really done a number
on you.

Mater, look -- things are different
over here. Which means maybe you
should, you know, act a little
different too.

Different than what?

Well, just... help me out here,
buddy. I ---


You need help? Shoot, why didn't
you just say so? That's what a tow
truck does. Hey, looky there, it's
Mr. San Francisco!

FRANCESCO is visible across the room, holding court.

I'll introduce you.

Mater, no.

(already on his way)
Look at me -- I'm helping you
already!

On FRANCESCO - MOMENTS LATER. Mater approaches, giddy.

Hey Mr. San Francisco, I'd like you
to meet ---

Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.

Nice to meet you, Francesco.

Yeah, nice to meet you too. You are
very good-looking. Not as good as I
thought, but you're good.

Excuse me. Can I get a picture with
you?

Anything for McQueen's friend.

As Mater poses for a photo with Francesco:

Miss Sally is gonna flip when she
sees this. She's Lightning
McQueen's girlfriend.

Oooh.


She's a big fan of yours.

Hey, she has good taste.

Mater's prone to exaggeration. I
wouldn't say she's a "big" fan.

You're right. She's a huge fan. She
goes on and on about your open
wheels here.

Mentioning it once doesn't qualify
as going "on and on."

Francesco is familiar with this
reaction to Francesco. Women
respect a car that has nothing to
hide.

Yeah, uh...

Let us have a toast.

McQueen doesn't like where this is going, covers.

Let's.

(raising a drink)
I dedicate my win tomorrow... to
Miss Sally.

Oh, sorry. I already dedicated MY
win tomorrow to her. So if we both
do it, it's really not so special.
Besides, I don't have a drink.

I'll go get you one. You mind if I
borrow a few bucks for one of them
drinks?


(could kill him)
They're free, Mater.

Free? Well, shoot, what am I doing
here?

Mater ZIPS OFF.

I should probably go keep an eye on
him. See you at the race.

McQueen starts to leave.

Yes, you will see Francesco. But
not like this.

Francesco does a 180, so his rear end now faces McQueen.

You will see him like this, as he
drives away from you.

Francesco wears a bumper sticker that says "Ciao, McQueen!"

That's cute. So you had one of
those made up for all the racers?

No.

Okay.

He rolls off.

He is so getting beat tomorrow.


Lights caress the main stage where a crowd has formed.

Ladies and gentlecars... Sir Miles
Axlerod!

MILES AXLEROD drives through an infinity fountain, appears.


It is my absolute honor to
introduce to you the competitors in
the first-ever World Grand Prix.
From Brazil. Number eight...

ON FINN MCMISSILE. He appears from the shadows, keeps a
careful distance from the stage. He ZEROES HIS GAZE ON ---

--- THE WORLD GRAND PRIX TV CAMERAS which roll, catching
Miles Axlerod's speech for publicity and posterity.

Finn's ONBOARD COMPUTER ANALYZES each one, compares to the
photos we saw him snap on the oil platform. Each one is "NOT
A MATCH." His view is suddenly disrupted by A BEAUTIFUL
SPORTS CAR. She approaches Finn. Meet HOLLEY SHIFTWELL.

A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no
radiator.

That's because it's air-cooled.

I'm Agent Shiftwell, Holley
Shiftwell from the Tokyo Station. I
have a message from London.

Not here.
You must try the canapes on the
mezzanine!

He moves her onto an elevator. The doors close on them.


So the lab boys analyzed the photo
I sent? What did they learn about
the camera?

It appears to be a standard
television camera. They said if you
could get closer photos next time,
that would be great.

This was London's message?


Oh -- no, no. No sir. Um, the oil
platforms you were on? Turns out
they're sitting on the biggest oil
reserve in the world.

How did we miss that?

They'd been scrambling everyone's
satellites. The Americans actually
discovered it just before you did.
They placed an agent on that
platform, under deep cover. He was
able to get a photo of the car
who's running the entire operation.

The doors OPEN and they exit onto the Mezzanine.

Who is it? Has anyone seen the
photo yet?

No, not yet. The American is here
tonight to pass it to you. He'll
signal you when he's ready.


Finn suddenly STOPS COLD.

Oh no.

Professor Zundapp is visible below them. He talks with a few
Pacers and Gremlins. Finn quickly retreats into the shadows.
Holley follows suit.

What is it?

Change of plan. You're meeting the
American.

What, me?


Those thugs down there were on the
oil platform. If they see me, the
whole mission is compromised.

No, no. I'm technical, you see. I'm
in Diagnostics. I'm not a field
agent.

You are now.

MATER as he grabs a drink, keeps moving.

I'll take one of them.

He snatches it, drops it in the back where we now see a large
assortment of drinks balanced.

Never know which one McQueen'll
have a hankering for.

He approaches a sushi bar.

Hey, what you got here that's free?
How about that pistachio ice cream?

He refers to wasabi, of course.

No, no. Wasabi.

Oh, same ol', same ol'. What's up
with you? That looks delicious.

The chef starts to carve a small scoop aside for Mater.

Uh, a little more, please.
It is free, right?
(the chef adds more)
Keep it coming. A little more. Come
on, let's go, it's free! You're
getting there... Scoop scoop!

The chef gives in. Scoops a baseball-sized ball out.


There you go. Now THAT's a scoop of
ice cream.

(in Japanese, subtitles)
My condolences.

MILES AXLEROD - He's now nearly done with his intros.

... and now, our last competitor ---
Number 95, Lightning McQueen!

MCQUEEN approaches the microphone, flashes his headlights.

Thank you so much for having us,
Sir Axlerod. I really look forward
to racing. This is a great
opportunity.

Oh, the pleasure is all ours,
Lightning. You and your team bring
excellence and professionalism to
this competition.

As if on cue, Mater arrives with a piercing scream of pain.
Everyone turns as he charges head first toward the stage,
making a bee-line for that FOUNTAIN.

Somebody get me water!

He laps up water from the fountain like a diabetic cat.

Sweet relief...

Miles Axlerod is shocked. The crowd can't believe it.
Francesco cackles. Mater, now sated, approaches the mic.

(to the crowd)
Whatever you do, do not eat the
free pistachio ice cream. It has
turned!

Sir Axlerod, I can explain. This is
Mater.


I know him. This is the bloke that
called into the television show.
You're the one I have to thank.

No, thank you. This trip's been
amazing.

He's a little excited, isn't he?

TILT DOWN to reveal a pool of oil beneath Mater.

Mater!

But wait, I... oh, shoot.

McQueen quickly pulls Mater aside, out of earshot of Miles
Axlerod and the others. McQueen is beside himself.

Mater, you have to get a hold of
yourself. You're making a scene.

But I never leak oil. Never.

Go take care of yourself right now.

Mater drives off.


He drives through the party, frantic.

Coming through! Excuse me, leakin'
oil. Where's the bathroom? Thank
you. I gotta go!

Someone points Mater down a hallway. He whips around the

--- and STOPS. Finds himself in front of TWO BATHROOM DOORS,
neither of which clearly indicate MALE or FEMALE.


What the...

Mater chooses one, drives inside. A SHRIEK is heard and Mater
zips out.

Sorry ladies!

He heads into the other door ---


Mater rolls in, still `holding it in' like a kid.

I never leak I never leak I never
leak...

He sees someone leaving a stall. He heads in.

IN THE STALL - Mater enters, looks up.

Wowee...

The stall is a complicated apparatus with buttons and lights.
High-tech Japanese. It suddenly GRABS MATER, hoists him up as
if he's going to get an oil change.

What in the---

A Japanese style cartoon CARICATURE appears on a TV MONITOR,
followed by images of waterfalls and rivers.

Hey, that tickles.

The caricature starts talking in Japanese. Suddenly WATER
FIRES UP underneath Mater's undercarriage, goosing him. He
freaks out.

OUTSIDE THE STALL - With Mater's yells audible we see a
GREMLIN enter, furtive. Suddenly, inexplicably, his frame
BREAKS APART like an egg, revealing an AMERICAN MUSCLE CAR
underneath. The pieces of the Gremlin disappear under him,
clearly his disguise. This is ROD REDLINE - American Agent.


Okay, McMissile. I'm here. It's
time for the drop.


HOLLEY, rolls along by herself. Nervous. DING! Her rearview
monitor springs to life.

The American has activated his
tracking beacon.

Roger that. Move in.


Rod Redline, waiting at a sink, feels a presence behind him.

GREM and ACER have entered, hesitate briefly when they see
Rod Redline.

Rod Redline, careful, slides a gun out of his tire. He is
suddenly CHARGED by the AMCs --- Rod SPINS AROUND and gets a
shot off but is SLAMMED HEAD FIRST. A TIGHT, CLOSE-QUARTERS
FIGHT begins ---

IN THE STALL - Mater, still TRAPPED, is now being SCRUBBED as
if in a car wash. He is helpless.

OUTSIDE THE STALL - Rod is being pulverized. Just when he
scrambles away from one car, the other one takes over.

IN THE STALL - Mater is mercifully released, but when he
backs out ---

--- Rod Redline is THROWN INTO MATER'S STALL DOOR, crunching
it and sending Mater ---

--- BACK INTO THE CLUTCHES of the insane toilet.


Holley isolates the tracking beacon's location in the party.

Oh, you've got to be joking.

What's the problem, Shiftwell?

He's in the loo.


So go in!

I can't just go into the men's loo.

Time is of the essence, Shiftwell.


Rod Redline is in bad shape. He backs away, betrays a look of
concern. He's in trouble here.

ACER burns rubber, ready to finish him off. Just as he shifts
into DRIVE ---

--- MATER'S STALL DOOR KICKS OPEN, knocking ACER out. Mater
jumps out, face-to-face GREM.

(out of breath)
Whatever you do, I would not go in
there.

The door SWINGS shut, revealing the pulverized Acer.

A Gremlin and a Pacer!

Rod Redline, now behind Mater and sensing an opportunity
here, quickly produces A SMALL DEVICE.

(to Grem and Acer)
No offense to your makes and
models, but you guys break down
harder than my cousin Betsy after
she got left at the ---

Rod Redline, surreptitiously attaches the device to Mater's
undercarriage.

(as he's goosed)
--- altar!

He spins around, sees Rod Redline for the first time.

Are you okay?

I'm fine.


Hey. Tow truck.

Mater turns back to Grem and Acer.

We'd like to get to our private
business here, if you don't mind.

Oh, yeah. Don't let me get in the
way of your "private business."
Oh! A little advice: When you hear
her giggle and see that waterfall,
you best press that green button.

Thank you.

It's to adjust the temperature.

Got it.

Remember it's in Celsius, not
Fahrenheit.

Get outta here!

Alright then.

Mater exits, leaving Rod Redline to a now even angrier Grem
and Acer.


Holley arrives at the door. She takes a breath, is about to
enter when Mater EXITS.

Excuse me, ma'am.

He passes her, expelling some exhaust in the process.
Holley's rearview tracking confirms that the device is on
him.

Dadgum pistachio ice cream.


This cannot be him.

Is he American?

(driving off, to himself)
Look out, ladies. Mater's fittin'
to get funky!

Extremely.

Then it's him.

It's settled. Holley takes one more nervous breath, quickly
closes the distance between her and Mater, cuts him off. He
is forced to STOP.

Hello.

Well, hello.

A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no
radiator.

Well of course it doesn't. That's
`cause it's air-cooled!

Perfect. I'm from the Tokyo Station

Course, Karmann Ghia's weren't the
only ones. Besides the Beetles you
had your Type-3 Squarebacks, with
the pancake motors...

Yeah. Okay, I get it---

... And before both of them,
there's the Type-2 buses - my buddy
Fillmore's one of them.


Listen! We should find somewhere
more private.

Uh, gee. Don't you think that's a
little, uh ---

You're right. Impossible to know
which areas here are compromised.
So, when can I see you again?

Well, let's see. Tomorrow I'll be
out there at the races.

Got it. We'll rendezvous then.


Mater returns to his team, lost in thought.

There you are. Where have you been?

What's a rendezvous?

It's like a date.

A date?!

Mater, what's going on?

Well, what's going on is I've got
me a date tomorrow.

Guido makes a crack in Italian.

Guido don't believe you.

Well, believe it. My new girlfriend
just said so. Hey, there she is.

Mater points out Holley, who's within earshot.


Hey! Hey lady!

Holley, caught in plain view, DRIVES OFF.

See ya tomorrow!

Guido makes another crack in Italian.

Guido still don't believe you.


An industrial dock, outside of the city proper.


Rod Redline dangles from a car magnet. He's been beaten up,
clings to consciousness.

I gotta admit ---

Grem, Acer, and a bunch of nasty looking troublemakers look
up at Rod amidst crates and shipping containers.

--- you tricked us real good.

And we don't like being tricked.

Rod Redline laughs to himself.

Hey, what's so funny?

Well, you know, I was just wearing
a disguise. You guys are stuck
looking like that.

This doesn't help him. They DROP HIM onto a TREADMILL, lock
him down. A container is wheeled forward and Rod is plied
with Allinol brand gasoline.

Allinol? Thanks, fellas. I hear
this stuff is good for you.


So you think.

The Professor emerges from the darkness, behind Rod.

Allinol by itself is good for you.

Zundapp hits a button and the TREADMILL starts Rod's wheels
spinning at a high rate of speed.

But after microscopic examination,
I have found that it has one small
weakness. When hit with an
electromagnetic pulse, it becomes
extremely dangerous.


Grem pushes a World Grand Prix CAMERA - the same one that
was in the box back at the oil derrick. He points it at Rod
Redline.

--- for the camera.

Is that all you want? I got a whole
act.

You were very interested in this
camera on the oil platform. Now you
will witness what it really does.

Whatever you say, Professor.

Acer pushes a TV MONITOR toward Rod. On it, surveillance
footage from the party. Clearly, they were watching and
recording him there.

You talked up a lot of cars last
night. Which one's your associate?

Your mother. Oh no, I'm sorry. It
was your sister. You know, I can't
tell them apart these days.


Could I start it now, Professor?

Fifty percent power.
(to Rod Redline)
This camera is actually an
electromagnetic pulse emitter.

(re: a girl on the TV)
What about her? Did you give it to
her?

The Allinol is now heating to a
boil, dramatically expanding,
causing the engine block to crack
under the stress, forcing oil into
the combustion chamber.

Rod Redline's engine starts to CRACK and BREAK.

(re: a guy on the TV)
How about him? You talk to him?

(to Professor Zundapp)
What do I care? I can replace an
engine block.

You may be able to, but after full
impact of the pulse, unfortunately,
there will be nothing to replace.

How about him? Does he have it?

The monitor reveals MATER, rolling out of the bathroom and
down the hall.

Rod Redline, seeing this, does the world's most subtle double
take. We caught it, but there's no way anyone else in the
room could have ---

That's him. He's the one.

Roger that, Professor Z.


No!

As Grem turns up the machine even MORE, the Professor makes a
call.

Yes sir. We believe the infiltrator
has passed along sensitive
information.
(beat, listening)
I will take care of it before any
damage can be done.

The Professor hangs up, turns to the room.

The project is still on schedule.
You will find this second agent ---

Zundapp kicks the camera's power into the RED.

--- and kill him.

On the MONITOR - With Mater's frozen image on the screen we
see Rod EXPLODE in the reflection.


Over television pre-roll of Japan:

Japan. Land of the rising sun.
Where ancient tradition meets
modern technology. Welcome to the
inaugural running of the World
Grand Prix.

ON OUR ANNOUNCERS as they introduce themselves:

I'm Brent Mustangburger, here with
racing legends Darrell Cartrip and
David Hobbscap. There's never been
a competition like this before.

SHOTS OF THE PITS as the racers fuel up.

First, Allinol, making its debut
tonight as the required fuel for
all these great champions.

Second, the course itself, and it's
like nothing we've ever seen.
David, how exactly does this
competition work?

Well, Brent, all three of these
street courses are classic round-
the-house racetracks.

OUTLINES OF THREE RACE COURSES are shown. They're labeled
Japan, Italy and England, and are different in shape and
size.

This means that the LMP and Formula
cars should break out of the gate
in spectacular fashion.

SHOTS OF THE RACERS as they weave up the track, practicing.

Look for Francesco Bernoulli in
particular to lead early.

SHOTS OF Francesco, featured in an inset.

And with a series of technical
turns throughout ---

MORE SHOTS of the course, now highlighting the tech turns.

GT and Touring cars like Spain's
Miguel Camino should make up some
ground but I doubt it'll be enough
to stop Francesco from absolutely
running away with it.

Woah, now just hold your
horsepower. You're forgetting the
most important factor here. That
early dirt track section of the
course! The dirt is supposed to be
the great equalizer in this race.

GRAPHICS OF THE COURSES now isolate a stretch after the first
couple turns, label it "DIRT SECTIONS."


French Rally car Raoul �aRoule is
counting on a big boost headed
through there.

And don't forget Lightning McQueen!
His mentor, the Hudson Hornet, was
one of the greatest dirt track
racers of all time. In my opinion,
McQueen is the best all-around
racer in this competition.


Really, Darrell, I think you need
to clean your windshield. You're
clearly not seeing this for what it
is: Francesco's race to lose.


It's time to find out. The racers
are locking into the grid ---

Engines rev as everyone gets ready to go. Everyone's bright
eyed and alert except for McQueen who we find in the back of
the grid. He CLOSES his eyes.

Speed. I am speed.

A LAUGH O.S. McQueen opens his eyes. Francesco is next to him
on the grid.

Really? You are "speed"? Then
Francesco is triple speed.
(closes his eyes)
Francesco. Is. Triple speed.
Francesco likes this, McQueen. It's
really getting him into the zone!

He is so getting beat today.

The starting lights click down from RED to YELLOW to GREEN.
The race begins. Francesco quickly grabs the lead. He's
pulling away within seconds.


ON PIT ROW - We TRACK PAST as the various Crew Chiefs on
their crash carts bark orders to their racers. We end on Team
McQueen. No Crew Chief, just a solid looking team.

His suspension stats look good.

Tire pressure is excellent.

He's got plenty of fuel.

And he's awesome!

The same view of Mater but now THROUGH A TELESCOPIC DISPLAY.
Reveal Finn and Holley watching from high above in a downtown
office building, behind reflective glass.

Why is he in the pits? He's so
exposed.

It's his cover. One of the best
I've seen, too. Look at the detail
on that rust. It must have cost him
a fortune.

But why hasn't he contacted us yet?

There's probably heat on him. Be
patient.

Right, of course. He'll signal us
when he can.

And then we find out who's behind
all this.

ON THE TRACK - VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE RACE through Tokyo as
Francesco extends his lead and McQueen attempts to make up
ground.


IN MCQUEEN'S PIT - Mater watches the monitors, sees them
approaching the dirt section.

McQueen! It's time to make your
move. Get on the outside and show
'em what Doc done taught you.

Ten four, Mater.

ON THE TRACK - Francesco hits the dirt section and loses all
control. He SLAMS to a halt, his tires getting no traction.

Francesco is brought to a
screeching halt!

MCQUEEN skids into view, turning right to go left, passing
Francesco, followed by other cars ---

Lightning McQueen is the first to
take advantage. And just like that,
folks, Francesco's lead is left in
the dust.

Nice call, Mater. Keep it up!

McQueen now leads the pack, zooming out of the dirt now
starting to relax.

Who-hoo! Man, McQueen looks happier
than a rollbar at a demolition
derby!


The field of cars thunders into a tunnel.

Everyone's jostling for position as
we hit the asphalt again.

Francesco crests the hill, in last place. He bites down,
determined, then CHASES.

Francesco lost a lot of momentum in
the dirt. He's got some serious
work ahead of him if he wants to
get back in this race.


VARIOUS SHOTS OF TOKYO as the racers move through the Rainbow
Bridge. Bit by bit, Francesco ekes his way toward the front,
toward Lightning McQueen as we CUT TO ---

--- A ROOFTOP, and a VIEW THROUGH THE WGP CAMERA LENS. Grem
and Acer are manning this one. They focus it on the racers as
they approach.

It is time.

Roger that.

ON THE TRACK - A racer (Miguel Camino) suddenly PLUMES WITH
SMOKE and skids out.

Oh! Miguel Camino has blown an
engine!

Very unusual, Darrell. He's been so
consistent all year.

Camino quickly pits, passing McQueen's pit where Mater is
visible.

ON GREM AND ACER, watching from above.

You gotta be kidding me.

What is it?

It's that tow truck from the
bathroom.

The one from the bathroom?

Yeah, the one the American Agent
passed the device to.

What about him?

What about him? He's in the pits!


Not for long.

Acer exits, with purpose.

ON FINN AND HOLLEY, still in their office hideaway. Holley's
onboard computer flashes an ALERT.

Hold on. I think I've got
something.

What is it?

The Pacer from the party last
night.

She's spotted Acer, moving swiftly forward.

Cross-referencing with the photos
from the oil derricks... Yep. His
VIN numbers match.

Anyone with him? He won't be alone.

Conducting analysis on the target.

The computer finds more and more bad guy Pacers and Gremlins
are in the crowd.

He's not the only one here.
Three... five... they're
everywhere. And they're all closing
in on... oh no.

We PAN OVER to see it's MATER.

Finn? Finn, where are you?

She turns. He's GONE, leaving only an open window.

Get him out of the pits now!

IN MCQUEEN'S PIT. A car WHIPS BY O.S.


Wow! Some of them fellers is really
loud.

Can you hear me? Over.

Uh, what?

Get out of the pit now. Do you hear
me?

Mater realizes this girl has somehow broken into his radio.

Hey, I know you. You're that girl
from the party last night. You
wanna do our date right now?

ON THE TRACK - McQueen boxes out Francesco, holds his slim
lead, but barely.

Guys, a little too much chatter.
Let's keep this line clear.

BOOM! A racer behind McQueen suddenly expels black smoke,
skids out of control.

ON GREM - laughing. That was clearly his handiwork.


There's no time for messing about.
You've got to get out of the pits.

Is there gonna be cable where you
is so I can watch the rest of the
race?

ON HOLLEY - Watching from the downtown building.

You're running out of time!

They're coming, Shiftwell.

Yes, I know.


Get him out of there.

I'm trying.
Get out now!

We CUT BACK TO ---

--- MATER. He gives in, exits the pit.

Well, all right but I usually like
to have a proper detailing done
before I meet a lady friend.

He moves toward the back PIT DOOR, is about to open it.

OUTSIDE THE PITS - ACER and another Pacer approach McQueen's
pit door on the other side. Ready to pounce. The doors OPEN,

--- Finn, holding a fire extinguisher.

Finn McMissile? But you're dead!

Then this shouldn't hurt at all.

He empties the extinguisher in their eyes, speeds past. They
try and follow, but have been blinded. One of them crashes
right into a COP.

ON FINN - Already on the move, along a side street.

Miss Shiftwell?

ON HOLLEY - Tracking everything on a grid map. Mater looks
like Pac Man, weaving through the streets as bad guys close
in all around him.

I've got him in the back alleys
east of the garages. Multiple
assailants are closing in quickly.

Keep him moving. I'm on my way.
